# Threat-Detection-with-GuardDuty
This project provides a hands‑on environment for exploring both offensive and defensive security techniques within AWS. It mirrors real‑world attack scenarios against a vulnerable web application and demonstrates how those activities surface within Amazon GuardDuty.
The goal is to give you practical experience identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities, while also learning how to detect, investigate, and interpret the resulting threat signals from a defender’s perspective.
This work aligns strongly with roles such as Security Analyst, Penetration Tester, and Cloud Security Engineer, where understanding attacker behaviour, cloud threat detection, and incident analysis is essential. It also reflects a broader interest in cloud security, automation, and structured technical documentation.
